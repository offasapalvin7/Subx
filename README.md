This will check the "can-i-take-over-xyz" service for takeover vulnerabilities on the specified subdomain. The script will output a message indicating whether the subdomain is potentially vulnerable to takeover, along with a list of any matching fingerprints. If there is an error checking the subdomain, the script will output an error message with the HTTP status code.




also add the  all 4 of the requested modifications:

#You can add additional command-line options to allow the user to specify different options when running the script. For example, you could add an option to specify the API endpoint to use, or an option to specify the output format.

#You can add additional checks to the script to cover more cases or handle more error conditions. For example, you could add checks to handle HTTP redirects, or to retry the request if it fails.

#You can add additional functionality to the script to perform additional tasks. For example, you could add a feature to scan multiple subdomains at once, or to save the results to a file.

#You can extend the script to integrate with other tools or services. For example, you could add a feature to send notifications when a takeover is detected, or to automatically take over a vulnerable subdomain.
